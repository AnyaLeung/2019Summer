* Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

* The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.


* Example 1:

```
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
```

* Example 2:
[](https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/mw690/006eV7Q0ly1g671cf5wnij30dw0cwaay.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
```

* Note:
* If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.
* It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.
